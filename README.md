# Efficient_Mobile_Denoising_Models
This framework includes the loading of different datasets as well as several denoising models. Several of the models are optimized for mobile usage. Those models include a simple U-Net, the winning models of the MAI2021 challenge by NOAHTCV and Megvii and the newly proposed SplitterNet. Furthermore there are ResNet_18, PlainNet, a classical UNet...
